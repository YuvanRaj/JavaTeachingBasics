/**
 * encapsulation is, it is a protective shield that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield. 
 * 	
 * Technically in encapsulation, 
 * the variables or data of a class is hidden from any other class and can be accessed only 
 * through any member function of its own class in which it is declared.
 * 
 * 
 * Encapsulation can be achieved by Declaring all the variables in the class as private and writing public methods 
 * in the class to set and get the values of variables
